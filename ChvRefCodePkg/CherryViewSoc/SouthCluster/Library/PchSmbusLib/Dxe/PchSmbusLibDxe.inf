#  DXE PCH Smbus Lib
#
#  This function provides a standard way to execute Smbus sequential
#  I2C Read. This function allows the PCH to perform block reads to
#  certain I2C devices, such as serial E2PROMs. Typically these data
#  bytes correspond to an offset (address) within the serial memory
#  chips.
